# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator App*

**Tip Calc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Adrian Torres**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Create a tip slider that adjusts the tip percentage
Make a tip splitting feature
A settings page to change the currency

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One challenge I encountered while building the app was checking that my outlets were connected to my view controller, since I sometimes recieved some errors. Also, a challenge I encountered while building the app was adding the logic to the app, due to not being familiar with some of the commands and methods that were being used in order to get the total amount. Another challenge I encountered while building the app was trying to implement a tip slider that adjusts the tip percentage, which I am still curious about. Overall my experience while building the app was great.
